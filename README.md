# Learning Experiments

A collection of small programming projects and experiments for hands-on learning and practice. These cover a variety of topics such as user input, control flow, functions, data structures, and more.

### 🧠 Purpose
This repository serves as a personal playground to explore programming concepts and build confidence through simple CLI-based projects.

### 🧪 Projects so far:
- 🎲 Number Guessing Game
- ✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors
- 🧮 Odd or Even Checker
- 🔤 Word Pyramid Generator
- ✅ To-Do List (text-based CLI)

### 🔧 Technologies
Mostly written in Python for now — may include other languages in the future.

### 📁 Structure
Each project lives in its own `.py` file or folder. There's no framework — just direct experimentation.
